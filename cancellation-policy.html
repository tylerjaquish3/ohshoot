CANCELLATION POLICY

Oh Shoot Photo Booth wants every customer to have an amazing time with a photo booth at their event. However, we do understand that even the best laid plans sometimes change. 

Oh Shoot Photo Booth will refund any amount you have paid back to you less the deposit to secure your date; when notification is given 30 days prior to your event. If for whatever the circumstance you cancel 30 days or less before the scheduled date of your event, then we will not be able to offer a refund of any amount. Oh Shoot Photo Booth requires a deposit to secure your date, and this prevents us from booking any other potential events for that day. 

We thank you for understanding our cancellation policy, and we will do everything in our power to make sure we can suit your events needs and date. If you know that your date may be subject to change, please let us know as soon as possible. We may be available for your alternate date and we would be able to move to another date at no extra charge if it is available. We will do everything in our power to make sure your event is the most memorable time you have ever had.
